# Event-Driven UAV Swamrs

## Launching the Simulation
To run the simulation, follow the instructions given in ```1_Instllations_and_InitialSetup.md``` and ```2_MultiUAV_Simulation.md``` in the docs directory. After the installations are complete, you can start the simulation using the following command:

```bash
roslaunch uav_swarms simulation.launch
```

This command will launch the simulation environment in Gazebo with 3 ArduPilot drones. 

To test the formation control script, open another terminal and run the following command:
